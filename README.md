# Umbrella-Weather

Umbrella Weather is a 2D platformer where the main character June bought some groceries, but has to get home in the heavy rain again with their umbrellas. In a set of levels, the player controls June to maneuvers/traverses the city to get home by using umbrellas to glide through, fly up on fans, get screwed over by fans, while avoiding getting the groceries wet from the pools of water and the never ending rain. You also have the choice to give your limited supply of umbrellas to the sad people in the rain without umbrellas as an optional challenge.
